As the administrator of your organization's computing applications, you are responsible for setting up and running a system that is critical to your corporate mission. You must plan how to maximize the performance and reliability of your GigaSpaces XAP, and then make it happen.

The primary focus of the Administrator's Guide, is to provide both a basic, as well as more advanced overview of the GigaSpaces XAP administration and operation components. That includes "how to", troubleshooting and reference documentation.

After reading this guide, administrators and operators will be able to set up, validate, configure, monitor and troubleshoot various aspects of the GigaSpaces XAP platform.

Note that this guide is specific to XAP administrators. For instructions for XAP.NET administrators, please refer to the [XAP.NET Administrator's Guide]({%currentneturl%}/administrators-guide.html).
